          Hello! My name is Matthew Mahnke, I'm a current student at Portland
          State University pursuing a Bachelor's degree in computer science with
          a projected graduation date of March 2024. While I don't yet have any
          professional experience, I'll be completing an internship in software
          engineering this summer with a focus in working with Python. I am
          proficient in C++, Python and Java, with brief experience in HTML,
          CSS, and JavaScript, which I'm hoping to work with a lot more in the
          near future. A majority of my classwork so far has focused on data
          structures and learning core fundamentals of computer science, for
          example object oriented programming and dynamic programming, but I'm
          excited to broaden my experience in the next few terms with classes on
          more specialized topics such as virtual reality and machine learning.
          I have a lot of areas of computer science I'm interested in that I've
          yet to experience fully, which makes it difficult to visualize what my
          future career may be like, but I'm very interested in machine learning
          and full-stack development!
