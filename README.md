# personal-website

My personal website created using a mix of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It contains sections About Me, Previous Work, Projects, and Contact.
Each section contains different information about myself, including my resume in the Preivous Work section, a simulator/game I created in the projects section,
and a form letting you connect with me in the Contact section. The website was largely laid out using the grid and flexbox systems with a focus on being responsive. 
Working on this website was a lot of fun and I'm planning on continuing it beyond this stage! I think it will be a cool project to continue deeloping and improving
as my own knowledge grows.

The typing effect on the introductory page was inspired by this source: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_typewriter.asp
The fade-in effects for certain elements loading in was inspired by this source: https://blog.hubspot.com/website/css-fade-in#:~:text=In%20the%20CSS%2C%20use%20the,creates%20the%20fade%2Din%20effect.
